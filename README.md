# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote.}

This code was written within Power Query in Power Bi. I created a Database File with Cowboy player stats. I exported all the tables into CSV files. The codes purpose combines the Dak, Pickens and Javontee csv 
files into one data source. The trouble was they are reporting different stats so I troubleshooted a way to use this into a dashboard view with in power BI.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

I wanted to create a simple dashboard with the purpose of easily seeing the stats of the 3 players. Since I was able to create one master data source I am able to use one view with slicers to switch between
the different players stats.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
